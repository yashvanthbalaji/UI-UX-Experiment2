## Aim:
To design a basic mobile and web layout for an existing case study.

## Algorithm:
## steps:
1.Use Figma, Canva and Adobe express for creating the logo designs.

2.Apply Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, alignment, hierarchy) to enhance the visual clarity of the mobile and web layouts.

3.Incorporate appropriate UI elements (buttons, forms, navigation bars, cards) and follow design patterns to ensure consistency.

4.Develop interaction behaviors (hover, click, transitions) and apply usability principles to improve user experience.

5.Create a brand logo using Canva, following styling and branding guidelines, and include it with the layouts.

## Output:

a. Applying Gestalt Principles
Proximity: Group navigation menus, workout categories, and pricing options closely so users can instantly see related items.
Similarity: Use consistent typography, colors (navy + orange from the logo), and button styles across both mobile and web.
Figure-Ground: Place content on a clean, light background so images, text, and CTAs (Call-to-Actions) stand out.
Continuity: Align elements (hero → features → membership → contact) in a smooth, top-to-bottom flow.
Closure: Use recognizable icons (dumbbell, stopwatch, heart rate) with simplified outlines that users can easily interpret.

b. UI Elements and Design Patterns
Mobile Layout :
Header: Logo centered, hamburger menu on top-right.
Hero Section: Full-width banner with motivational tagline and “Join Now” button.
Quick Access Cards: Rounded cards for Workouts, Trainers, Nutrition, Membership.
CTA Button: Sticky bottom button (Join Now).

Accessibility: High-contrast colors, alt text for images, large fonts for readability.
Navigation Usability: Sticky header on web, bottom CTA on mobile for quick signups.
Micro interactions: Animated transitions between sections, hover effects on pricing cards, and progress indicator during sign up.


d. Brand Logo
Typography: Bold, modern sans-serif for SYNERGY and lighter font for FITNESS.
Color Scheme: Navy blue (strength & trust) + bright orange (energy & motivation).
Symbolism: A muscular figure lifting weights integrated with the “S” of Synergy, representing power, growth, and balance.
Consistency: The same logo will be used across mobile and web layouts to reinforce brand identity.
